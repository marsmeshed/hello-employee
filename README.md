# hello-employee

## Description

  This application is a simple SQL employee tacker. Using various technologies you are able to add not just employee's, but job roles, and more. You are then able to update said employee's and it'll save to your local database. During my time working with this project, I was able to better understand certain SQL elements as well as a further understanding regarding ".then()" statements.

## Installation

First, enter your terminal. After entering said terminal, run the application by using "node server.js" you will then be prompted with questions. Pick a prompt that most suits your situation and continue.
